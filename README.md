## Anything User Needs to Play/Run Game
	In my experience, the game is primarily intuitive; however, the user may need to make an effort to lean their head back in order to see all of the text instructions. Additionally, it is important to note that each color should be returned to its respective receptacle in order to complete the game. It is also easy to get trapped in the treacherous terrain dividing the island so beware!

## Why did I make this? Intention or Motivation
	We as a society are becoming more and more urban, and while natural exploration such as hiking, geocaching, and sightseeing are still mainstays in many parts of the world where nature is abundant, we are losing our nature to catastrophes such as forest fires due to climate change. It may one day be a certain reality that we can no longer experience nature in the way that we once used to, and in this case, experience like these built around understanding the pure human joy of being one with nature is going to become more and more meaningful.
	Additionally, given my upbringing in towns with relatively little sprawling nature, I always value my vacations to beautiful sceneries and the opportunity to soak in natural beauty; however, taking a vacation at any given point in time is not a possibility and sometimes in order to relieve stress, navigating an unbeforeseen landscape in the hopes of finding awe-inspiring beauty is the way to go. This could certainly be accomplished through Virtual Reality. Additionally, the exceptional aspect of using digitally generated environments could potentially be used to experience hyperrealistic environments that do not necessarily exist in real life. This is one such thing that makes VR a good medium for a geocaching-related experience.

## Limitations
	Virtual reality is only a visual medium and is hence not conducive at all in current circumstances for temperature, humidity, etc. to create a truly immersive outdoors experience. Additionally, the aroma of the greenery contributes greatly to an outdoors experience in real life, but this is again not available to us in a virtual reality setup. Additionally, spending a long time in an unrefined virtual reality experience can result in cybersickness, which is certainly something I experienced in testing my project.
